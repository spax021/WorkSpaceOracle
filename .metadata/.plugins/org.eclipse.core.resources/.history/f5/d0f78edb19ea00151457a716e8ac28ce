//	Consider the following code snippet.

//	Which operators does the code contain? ADDITIVE AND GREATER THAN

//	Consider the following code snippet.
	//	int i = 10;
	//	int n = i++%5;
		//	a. What are the values of i and n after the code is executed? 10 AND 0
		//	b. What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix 
			//	increment operator (i++), you use the prefix version (++i))? 10 AND 1

//	To invert the value of a boolean, which operator would you use? !
//	Which operator is used to compare two values, = or == ?     ==
//	Explain the following code sample: result = someCondition ? value1 : value2;
	/*IF someCondition IS TRUE, IT WILL SHOW value1, OTHERWISE IT WILL SHOW value2*/
