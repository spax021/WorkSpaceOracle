//		Operators may be used in building EXPRESSIONS, which compute values.
//		Expressions are the core components of STATEMENTS.
//		Statements may be grouped into BLOCKS.
//		The following code snippet is an example of a COMPOUND expression.
//		 1 * 2 * 3

//		Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages, 
//		but instead of ending with a period, a statement ends with a SEMICOLON.
//		A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced BRACES and 
//		can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.
		
		
//		Identify the following kinds of expression statements:
		
//		aValue = 8933.234;						ASSIGNMENT
//		aValue++;								INCREMENT
//		System.out.println("Hello World!");		METHOD INVOCATION
//		Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle();			OBJECT CREATION
