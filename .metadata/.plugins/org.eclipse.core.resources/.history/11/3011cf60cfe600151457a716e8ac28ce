//	Real-world objects contain STATE and BEHAVIOR.
//	A software object's state is stored in CLASS.
//	A software object's behavior is exposed through METHODS.
//	Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through 
//								publicly exposed methods is known as data ENCAPSULATION.
//	A blueprint for a software object is called a CLASS.
//	Common behavior can be defined in a SUPERCLASS and inherited into a SUBCLASS using the EXTENDS keyword.
//	A collection of methods with no implementation is called an INTERFACE.
//	A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a PACKAGE.
//	The term API stands for APPLICATION PROGRAMING INTERFACE?
